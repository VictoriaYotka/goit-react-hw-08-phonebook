### [About](#about)

Phonebook is a React app that provides simple and useful functionality to every
user and made with the help of React & Redux Toolkit, uses backend on Swagger
(fetches with CreateAsyncThunk and Axios).

It was created as my educational project while studying Frontend development.

Phonebook is usable both on PC and phone due to responsive layout made with
Chakra-UI features.
